"""script_widget.executor
=========================

The engine behind the ``%%exercise`` widget: run a cell body in a **fresh
subprocess** -- a brand-new Python interpreter, spawned fresh and discarded
after exactly one run -- not merely a fresh namespace in the current
process. Nothing a cell defines, imports, or mutates persists past that one
run, and nothing the notebook has already defined or imported is visible to
it at all: even ``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`` inside the cell gets a
genuinely fresh module, not a ``sys.modules`` cache hit handing back the
notebook's own live object, so a mutation like
``plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 5`` inside the cell can never leak back
out.

``run_exercise`` never raises: a ``SyntaxError`` from the cell, any
exception the cell's own code raises, or the subprocess dying outright is
caught and reported via ``ExerciseResult.error``/``.traceback`` instead.

    outputs : list of dict
        Rich display MIME bundles produced by the cell -- a trailing bare

        matplotlib figure flushed after execution. Each entry maps MIME

    error : str or None
        A short ``"ExceptionType: message"`` summary if the cell failed to

    - if it's a bare expression (``ast.Expr``), the expression's value;

      error there is still caught by the caller -- but there is no

    The cell body runs in a brand-new Python interpreter -- spawned via
    ``multiprocessing`` (the ``"spawn"`` start method specifically: safe to
    call from a live, multi-threaded Jupyter kernel process, unlike
    ``fork``), one disposable process per call, never reused across cells.
    That's what makes the isolation real: an ``import`` inside the cell
    always gets a genuinely fresh module, even for something the notebook
    has already imported -- there's no ``sys.modules`` cache hit handing
    back the notebook's own live object, and no way for the cell to mutate
    shared state (e.g. matplotlib ``rcParams``) that's still visible once
    the subprocess exits.

    The subprocess sets up its own throwaway IPython shell (via
    ``IPython.testing.globalipapp``, with ``%matplotlib inline`` enabled)
    so stdout/stderr, rich ``display()`` output, and matplotlib figures are
    still captured exactly as before -- that capture machinery
    (``_run_with_ipython``) is unchanged, just running on the other side of
    a process boundary now. One consequence: a figure drawn inside
    ``%%exercise`` renders with a pristine default backend/rcParams, not
    whatever the notebook's own matplotlib session has been configured to
    at runtime -- there's no live session left to share.
